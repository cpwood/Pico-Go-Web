## Introduction

Using the REPL console is easy. Type any MicroPython command, use tab to auto-complete or arrow keys to go back in history.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

You can use any of the following commands:

- `CTRL-B`: Enter friendly REPL
- `CTRL-C`: Stop any running code
- `CTRL-D`: Soft reset
- `CTRL-E`: Paste mode
- `CTRL-F`: Safe boot

`Ctrl-C` and `Ctrl-V` (or `Command-C` /  `Command-V` on a Mac) can also be used to copy and paste in the console.
