## GitHub issues

All bugs and enhancements are managed as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/cpwood/Pico-Go/issues). Please make sure you use the appropriate template; it's there to help the developers, so don't just `ctrl+a` and delete it!

If you're reporting a bug, including the output from `Pico-Go > Extra > Get support info` really helps.
